<h1>About</h1>

<p>Julie was born in Gambrills, Maryland in 1975 and currently resides in Longmont, CO. She received her Masters in Fine Art (MFA) from the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) in 2009. Her work is comprised of video, sound, fibers, and some drawing. Julie spends her time wandering about and paying attention to all of the tiny things that are typically overlooked. Through this wandering, she has developed an interest in the small, unnoticed moments that surround us. Julie's work has been shown in galleries in Baltimore, Washington, DC, New York, Portland, Los Angeles, and other cities. She also writes an occasional show review for art blogs and has in the past written for art magazines.</p>
